TRANSCRIPT:

Kowshik: "Good morning everyone! Let's kick off the standup. Priya, want to start with your updates?"

Priya: "Sure! Yesterday I completed the database migration for the legacy system. All tests passed and we're ready for the rollout next week. The team is still working on the API integration layer - should be done by EOD today."

Kowshik: "Great! Any blockers?"

Priya: "No major blockers, but I'm waiting on the security review from the platform team. Shouldn't impact the timeline though."

Kowshik: "Good to know. On my end, I've been working on the documentation for the new features and preparing the demo for the steering committee. I've also been coordinating with the architecture team on the infrastructure changes."

Priya: "What's the status on the client feedback integration?"

Kowshik: "We got initial feedback yesterday - mostly positive on the new UI. There are a couple of feature requests, which I've logged and prioritized. We can address them in the next sprint."

Priya: "Sounds good. One more thing - I noticed some performance issues in the staging environment. Should we investigate?"

Kowshik: "Yes, let's add that to the tech debt list. Can you create a task for it?"

Priya: "Will do right after this call."

Kowshik: "Perfect. Let's sync up with the team tomorrow on the overall progress. That's it for today's standup."
