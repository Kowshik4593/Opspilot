CRITICAL: Acme CoreAPI auth issue requires 3-day hotfix (due Wed evening) - war room scheduled for tomorrow 8 AM with Sara, Priya, QA. Prepared RCA and recovery plan for Rajesh's board brief. GlobalTech firewall blocker threatens Feb 10 pilot deadline - escalation decision needed (3-4 week fix vs 2-week workaround). TechVision Phase 2 on track - budget approved, arch deep-dive scheduled Feb 3. Key blockers: (1) Acme hotfix execution, (2) GlobalTech network decision, (3) Rajesh's board brief. High stress day but all critical issues have action plans.",
